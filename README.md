### [BART(Language Model) Fine-tuning](https://github.com/rocktrees/CS6301.git)
Fine-tuned BART to do question generation on a korean dataset.

The twist here is that BART's original training dataset was primarily english, but it was able to work

### [Kmeans from scratch](https://github.com/rocktrees/6375Assignment3.git)

It is written in python with a focus on OOP and ease of use
