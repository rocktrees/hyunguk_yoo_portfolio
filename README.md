## Welcome! 

I have made this my designated "table of contents" of my public work for anyone interesting in looking!

Have fun,

Josh Yoo


### Kmeans from scratch
I created a custom [Kmeans library](https://github.com/rocktrees/6375Assignment3.git) that is able to 

1.  (ofcourse)work properly
2.  save a log
3.  save a SSE vs K plot

It is written in python with a focus on OOP and ease of use

### Statistical Analysis(concrete strength)
I have done a detailed statistical analysis on [concrete strenth](https://github.com/rocktrees/ConcreteStrength.git)
